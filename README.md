Schnapsen AI: Bots with different risk-based strategies for the two-player card game using Monte Carlo Tree Search

The two-player card game Schnapsen is a game
where strategy is key. Two players start with five cards in their hand
and every player has only one chance to win a trick. Is a player taking
higher risks more likely to win, or are safe games the way to success?
This paper presents a comprehensive research focused on risk strategies
during the game Schnapsen. The research highlights the benefits and
drawbacks of playing with a greater, average or smaller risk, compared to
and against other already existing bots. Therefore the research question:
How do various risk assessment methodologies in algorithmic decision-
making impact the botâ€™s win rate in Schnapsen?
